A project for creating ledclock. 
The project contains the source for the actual clock and is depended
on a couple of breakouts, RTC, LDR and PIR.

This is tied together with an msp430g2553 to display the time on a ledclock
and be energy sufficient.

Besides the software I've made a 3D drawing which will be milled out of a mix
of materials, plexiglas, carbonfiber and MDF.
